      <p>Hi! I'm Beth. I was born and raised in
          Southeast Kansas. I currently call Oswego home, with hopes of relocating
          to a bigger city in the near future. I'm a 32-year-old mother of two who
          loves all things music, exploring the outdoors, and spending time with
          my kids.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently attending the KU full-stack web development bootcamp with
          a projected completion date in early 2021. I'm new to coding, but have
          always had an interest in persuing it. Prior to starting the bootcamp, I
          was a pre-school paraprofessional. Coding is a huge change from my last
          profession, but it's something I'm very excited about.
